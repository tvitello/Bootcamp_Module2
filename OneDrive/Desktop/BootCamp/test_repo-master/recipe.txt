A recipe for Srirach-filled cucumber.

1) Take a cucumber

2) Remove the ends of the cucumber, then wash and peel the cucumber

3) Partially hollow out the cucumber from the top side, but leave the bottom side in-tact.

4) Pour Sriracha into the the hollowed out cucumber from the top side, filling the cucumber to within a quarter inch of the top surface

5) Periodically tap the cucumber onto a hard surface to ensure the Sriracha is flowing into the cucumber (this can help release trapped air bubbles, etc.)

6) Enjoy!
