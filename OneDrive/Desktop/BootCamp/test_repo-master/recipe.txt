PB&J Recipe:

1) Take two slices of bread

2) Take Peanut Butter and apply to one slice of bread with a butter knife

3) Take Jelly and apply to other slice of bread with a butter knife (if same knife as in previous step, clean before this step)

4) Put both slices of bread together. Serve.

Optional: Using a novelty bread slicer, cut sandwich into a whimsical shape (like a dinosaur, such as found here: https://www.thisiswhyimbroke.com/dinosaur-sandwich-cutter/).
